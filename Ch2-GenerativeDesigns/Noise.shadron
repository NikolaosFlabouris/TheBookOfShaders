// Implementaion of the functions described in
// The Book of Shaders, Chapter: Generative Designs - Random.

// Many of the functions in the chapter are for learning about how
// the random functions are calculated. A little bit too low level
// as a library with noise functions will often be available, no
// need to implement them. Will add functions later if required.
